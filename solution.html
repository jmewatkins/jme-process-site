						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p class="info">After researching my client, as well as other successful sites of similar organizations, I came up with my call-to-action. I also developed a style tile.</p>
					</header>
					
					<h2>Call to Action</h2>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA1.jpg" alt="CTA 1" /></span></div>
							<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA2.jpg" alt="CTA 2" /></span></div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>I had a hard time narrowing down what I wanted my call-to-action to be. The Animal Rescue Fund site wants to accomplish so much, and it didn't really have a clear call-to-action from the start. I ended up narrowing it down to "donate," "volunteer," and "adopt." Adopt and Volunteer are in the center of the image to draw more attention to them. I felt that getting more adoptions and volunteers would be more beneficial to ARF than just getting more monetary donations. I also included a possible logo, with the "Animal Rescue Fund" being what it starts on. It would then turn into "ARF" after scrolling down. You can see what the "ARF" would look in the second image.</p>
					<p>This specific CTA puts more emphasis on "volunteer" and "adopt" but also includes "donate" as a kind of secondary call-to-action.</p>
					<hr>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<p>In this style tile I showcased possible colors, icons, and interface elements that would communicate the "essence" ARF is aiming for.</p>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row 50% uniform">
							<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/StyleTile.jpg" alt="Style tile" /></span></div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>First I started off by determining certain adjectives that best reflected what ARF was aiming to be. The adjectives I came up with were trustworthy, inviting, approachable, friendly, serious, but also fun. Some of these adjectives ARF is already trying to convey, but others, such as serious, I felt could add to the trustworthiness of the website and increase user interaction.</p>

					<p>I then came up with a color palette that matched the adjectives I came up with. These colors all fit together well, and provide color without being too overwhelming or bright. I felt these communicated the adjectives well.</p>
		
					<p>After this, I began matching my style tile/theme with fonts and possible textures that would fit well with the website and communicate the adjectives. The fonts provide a serious feel while the textures provide the fun and approachable feel. I wanted to use textures that had a sort of "glow" to them. I felt they looked friendly, fun, and also approachable.</p>

					<p>This style tile also includes my call-to-action, which features the logo I designed for ARF.</p>
