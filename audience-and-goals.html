						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After completing the primary and secondary research, I looked towards my audience. Who would be viewing this website? Who would be using this website? I then looked at certain goals that applied to my audience.</p>
					</header>
			<!-- audience -->
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p>I began by listing the people who were involved with my client as well as the skeptics/critics of ARF.</p>
					<div class="row">
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience1.jpg" alt=""></span></div>
							<div class="8u$"><p>This was the result of my first attempt at defining my audience. I came up with three main groups, the donors, volunteers, and people looking to adopt. After that, I began brainstorming members of each of these broad groups. I then turned to the skeptics, and listed those.</p></div>
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience2.jpg" alt=""></span></div>
							<div class="8u$"><p>After determining members of each of the broad groups, I began to see that many of them contained the same members. Some members fit every group, such as "animal lovers." I then rearranged my cards to include a "fits into all three" and to show which members fit into more than one, but not all.</p></div>
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/audience4.jpg" alt=""></span></div>
							<div class="8u$"><p>I then narrowed my audience down further by grouping together all families and no longer distinguishing between families with children, etc. This gave me my main audience, adults, college students, animal lovers, families, and high school students.</p></div>
