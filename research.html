						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p class="info">I researched my client, the Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina, as well as various other animal rescue sites. I also dug up some articles containing recent news in this field.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Primary Research</h2>
					<h3>From the Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina</h3>
					<p>The Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina is a non-profit, no-kill animal shelter. It was founded by Dr. Roger Ross of FoxNest Veterinary. ARF aims to save and provide comfortable lives for pets who have been abandoned. They also aim to provide the community with educational information about being a good pet owner as well. They run on donations, and most of the work at this shelter is done by volunteers. This facility also provides the rescued animals with medical care, which mostly comes from the staff of FoxNest Veterinary.</p>

					<h5>The Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina's Mission</h5>
					<p>They list their mission, which features three statements, on their homepage.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>To save the lives of pets who have been abandoned to fend for themselves.</li>
						<li>To make those pets in our care healthy, comfortable, and loved until we can find a responsible new home for them.</li>
						<li>To encourage responsible pet care, including neutering, vaccinations, parasite control, and veterinary care.</li>
					</ol>

					<h5>Their Facility</h5>
					<p>On their homepage they also include information about their facility. This includes how many pets they can handle and what they do at the facility. They have room for about 25 pets at a time, and they aim to place 300 pets in their forever home each year. When they rescue an animal, they bathe them, give them a name, and treat their wounds and illnessess if needed. They also test the animals for anything, such as heartworms, intestinal worms, and leukemia. They vaccinate the animals and treat fleas, ticks, and ear mites. They also spay or neutur each pet. After this, they continue to provide care and love until the animal finds their forever home.</p>

					<h5>How to Help</h5>
					<p>Under the information about their facility they include ways that the reader can help. Of course, this includes donations, but it also includes other things. They could become an ARF angel, which is someone who sponsors the adoption of an animal. They encourage people to come adopt if they can. ARF includes direct ways someone can volunteer, such as offering to help clean the kennels, walking the dogs, and even socializing with the cats. Besides monetary donations, they also accept cleaning supplies and non-clumping cat litter.</p>

					<h5>Contact</h5>
					<p>At the bottom of this DIV they include ways to contact the facility, as well as directions to the place. They include their phone number (864-882-4488) and their email (ARF@NCTV.com). Finally they provide the address and directions to the facility. </p>

					<h5>Links</h5>
					<p>This website included a lot of links. The important ones are the cats and dogs in need of homes, their policies, and a link directing the reader to information on how to help. It’s a bit difficult to navigate, as the adoption information and requirements are under “our policies,” which doesn’t seem like the first place to look. There are SO many links on the side navigation bar, some of which are completely different websites. Some information is repeated in multiple sections, and it’s not very organized. Some of these are completely unnecessary links.</p>

					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
					<h3>Articles</h3>
					<h5><a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/pandemic-impacts-animal-rescue-operations">Covid Impacts Rescue Operations</a></h5>
					<p>Covid is impacting everything around us. One effect that many people probably don't think about is how Covid is impacting animal rescue groups. Lucky Cat Rescue, Giles Country Animal Control, and Giles Country Sheriff's Departments (in Tennessee) were called to a property where they found a number of animals living in terrible conditions. Because of Covid, they had to reduce the number of people who could help in the rescue, which caused them to be a the scene much longer than they usually would. Of course, the members were required to wear masks, get their temperature checked, and they had to alter where they planned the rescue. Overall, Covid is changing how animal rescue groups work.</p>
					<h5><a href="https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics">Rescue Statistics</a></h5>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Around 6.5 million animals enter U.S. shelters every year.</li>
							<li>Around 1.5 million animals are euthanized in shelters every year. More cats than dogs. (860,000: 670,000)</li>
							<li>Around 3.2 million animals are adopted from shelters every year.</li>
							<li>APPA reports that around 34% of dogs are bought from breeders. Only 23% of dogs and 31% of cats are adopted from shelters or the humane society.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Successful Animal Rescue Websites</h3>
					<h5>ASPCA</h5>
					<p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is a humane society, non-profit organization. Their mission is "to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States." I found this site to very successful. It's immediately clear what the user is supposed to do, as there are two donation buttons (one in the nav and one on the banner). It's in big, bold font "Join Us Today" encouraging the user to click the button. It's overall very organized. Their response to animal cruelty is immediately under the banner, with an option to stay up to date by signing up for your email and phone number. Below that, there are three buttons. "Donate" "Join Team ASPCA" and "Give Monthly." This leaves no room for the user to question what they are supposed to do. This website also features a footer, and it's a nice footer at that.</p>

						</div>
					</div>

					<h5>Humane Society</h5>
					<p>The Humane Society of the United States is another non-profit animal rescue organization. Again, it's immediately clear what the user is supposed to do. There's an obvious donate button in the navigation bar, along with pertinent links. As the user scrolls down, it becomes clear what the Humane Society's goal is, to end all forms of animal cruelty. It introduces the animal rescue team, giving a short explanation of what they do. After this is another donation button, again subtly letting the user know what to do. The Humane Society also features a footer, with an option to sign up to get alerts with news and "action alerts."</p>

					<h2>Interviews</h2>
					<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to get into contact with anyone at Animal Rescue Fund. Since I was unable to get a true client interview, I decided to interview a close family friend who works as a vet tech and is also a part of my audience. I also interviewed my aunt, who rescued her dog from another non-profit animal organization.</p>
					<h3>Kersten Fulton</h3>
					<p>For my first interview, I decided to interview Kersten, a close family friend. She works as a vet tech at Banfield Pet Hospital at Petsmart. She is the mother of a one year old and loves animals.</p>
						<div class="interview">
							<p><b>What is your current job?</b><br>I work as a vet tech at Banfield Pet Hospital at Petsmart.</p>

							<p><b>Have you or any of your coworkers volunteered to help at a non-profit shelter?</b><br>Yes, in high school my whole class volunteered at PAWS.</p>

							<p><b>What are your hobbies?</b><br>I don't do much anymore. Raising a one year old!</p>

							<p><b>Do you currently have any pets?</b><br>Yes, three dogs, Sophie, Reece, and Grizzy.</p>

							<p><b>Have you ever considered adopting an animal from a non-profit animal rescue</b><br>Our family dog came from a non-profit rescue. She's since passed away, though.</p>

							<p><b>When visiting an animal rescue site, what information are you expecting to find?</b><br>I expect to find information about the animals up for adoption. I also expect to find information about who the organization is and what their mission is.</p>
							
							<p><b>Have you ever volunteered at a shelter, and if so, how did you decide to volunteer for that place?</b><br>Yes, for PAWS in high school. Our class decided to volunteer to help PAWS as they were just setting up. We helped them to set up and take care of the animals.</p>

							<p><b>What information do you think should be included on a non-profit animal rescue website?</b><br>I think it should clearly state that it is a non-profit so people know that any kind of donations are needed and greatly appreciated, since they pay for things out of pocket. I think they should tell what their mission is and who they are. Again, I think they should include detailed descriptions of the animals available for adoption.</p>

							<p><b>Does the design of a website, consciously or unconsciously, sway your decision about whether that site is trustworthy?</b><br>If there is not much information, it pushes me away. It should be detailed.</p>

							<p><b>What makes a site seem trustworthy/safe to donate to?</b><br>Detailed descriptions of what the donations will be used for. Also, a secure way to provide donations, such as paypal. I don't like when sites ask for credit card information instead of offering paypal.</p>

							<p><b>If you wanted to see which animals were up for adoption, would you be more likely to check their website or their social media?</b><br>Probably their social media.</p>

							<p><b>What do you currently like about the ARF site, what do you dislike?</b><br>I like that they tell what their mission is. However, I feel it's way too crowded. There's too much on the homepage, too much information crammed together. It's not obvious where I should look for certain information.</p>

							<p><b>How could the ARF website be improved in your opinion?</b><br>I believe more tabs could help this website. Everything is thrown on the homepage, a more organized hierarchy system would be helpful. I think they should add what animals are currently available.</p>

							<p>This interview helped me to understand things from two perspectives, as an audience member and as a potential client, since they offer veterinary care at ARF. An important thing for animal organizations/businesses, including vets, is to provide clear, concise information about who they are, what they do and what they offer. It also helped me to see that even as a vet tech, audience members can be hesitant to trust animal organizations for various reasons, such as accessibility of the site and the amount of information presented.</p>
						</div>

					<h3>Linda Tinsley</h3>
					<p>For my second interview, I decided to interview my aunt. She is now retired and absolutely adores her dog, Leo, and spoils him rotten. She loves animals and since she rescued Leo, I think she's a perfect representation of my audience.</p>
					<div class="interview">
						<p><b>What is your current job?</b><br>I'm now retired, but I used to work as a supply chain planner at Michelin Tire Corporation.</p>

						<p><b>What are your hobbies?</b><br>I enjoy traveling and going to the beach.</p>

						<p><b>Do you currently have any pets?</b><br>Yes, I have a dog named Leo.</p>

						<p><b>Have you ever considered adopting an animal from a non-profit animal rescue</b><br>I did. I adopted Leo, a rescue, from PAWS in Anderson.</p>

						<p><b>When visiting an animal rescue site, what information are you expecting to find?</b><br>I expect to find information on the animals up for adoption, such as their age, whether they have been neutered or spayed, and their situation that caused them to become a rescue in the first place. Also whether they are housebroken, any special needs, etc. I think information about who works at the organization is important. I also expect to find information about the organization itself./p>
						
						<p><b>Have you ever volunteered at a shelter, and if so, how did you decide to volunteer for that place?</b><br>I have not.</p>

						<p><b>What information do you think should be included on a non-profit animal rescue website?</b><br>I think it should include all the information I mentioned earlier. Detailed information is always important.</p>

						<p><b>Does the design of a website, consciously or unconsciously, sway your decision about whether that site is trustworthy?</b><br>Not necessarily the design of a site, but the accessibility of a site definitely does. Like, entering information. If it's hard to do that, I'm less inclined to use that site.</p>

						<p><b>What makes a site seem trustworthy/safe to donate to?</b><br>I think ease of access makes a site seem trustworthy. As well as providing previous customer testimonials.</p>

						<p><b>If you wanted to see which animals were up for adoption, would you be more likely to check their website or their social media?</b><br>I would check their website.</p>

						<p><b>What do you currently like about the ARF site, what do you dislike?</b><br>It seems crowded. It's hard to read on mobile, it doesn't scale at all, so ease of access is definitely not here. I do like that it provides a lot of information, however, it seems very unorganized. There's no list of what animals are available to adopt, that's not good either.</p>
						
						<p><b>How could the ARF website be improved in your opinion?</b><br>I think that making the site accessible would improve it greatly. There should be ways to apply to volunteer through the site and apply to adopt through the site. Previous customer testimonials would also be an improvement.</p>

						<p>This interview helped me to understand what the website needed to include in order for typical audience members to trust and be inclined to help the Animal Rescue Fund. Information about the animals up for adoption, as well as information about the organization and who the main players are, are important. Additionally, previous customer testimonials can increase the trust in ARF.</p>
