						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">An important step in this process was defining what the Design Challenge was. I used the questions from the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit to help me define my design challenge.</p>
					</header>

						<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
						<p>Stopping animal cruelty in upstate South Carolina.</p>

						<h3>Frame it as a design question.</h3>
						<p>How can the Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina's website encourage people to help stop animal cruelty?</p>

						<h3>Now, state the ultimate impact you're trying to have.</h3>
						<p>The goal is to get more people to visit ARF's website, as well as encourage, and hopefully increase, donations and volunteers.</p>

						<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
						<p>Cleaning up the website, making the navigation bar more concise and clear, having a footer with the location and contact information, hierarchy, a simpler design, donation button in the nav bar, get rid of links that aren't pertinent to the cause, easier to navigate, appeal to a wide demographic.</p>

						<h3>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you're facing.</h3>
						<p>It's a local animal rescue group. Relatively unknown organization compared to others. It needs to be easy for a wide demographic to navigate, fit to all screens. Also, some people only donate to big, well-known non-profits like ASPCA.</p>

						<h3>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
						<p>How can the redesign of the AFR website make navigation easier and encourage more donations, volunteers, and adoptions.</p>
