						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p class="info">I researched my client, the Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina, as well as various other animal rescue sites. I also dug up some articles containing recent news in this field.</p>

					<h2>Primary Research</h2>
					<h3>From the Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina</h3>
					<p>The Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina is a non-profit, no-kill animal shelter. It was founded by Dr. Roger Ross of FoxNest Veterinary. ARF aims to save and provide comfortable lives for pets who have been abandoned. They also aim to provide the community with educational information about being a good pet owner as well. They run on donations, and most of the work at this shelter is done by volunteers. This facility also provides the rescued animals with medical care, which mostly comes from the staff of FoxNest Veterinary.</p>

					<h5>The Animal Rescue Fund of South Carolina's Mission</h5>
					<p>They list their mission, which features three statements, on their homepage.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>To save the lives of pets who have been abandoned to fend for themselves.</li>
						<li>To make those pets in our care healthy, comfortable, and loved until we can find a responsible new home for them.</li>
						<li>To encourage responsible pet care, including neutering, vaccinations, parasite control, and veterinary care.</li>
					</ol>

					<h5>Their Facility</h5>
					<p>On their homepage they also include information about their facility. This includes how many pets they can handle and what they do at the facility. They have room for about 25 pets at a time, and they aim to place 300 pets in their forever home each year. When they rescue an animal, they bathe them, give them a name, and treat their wounds and illnessess if needed. They also test the animals for anything, such as heartworms, intestinal worms, and leukemia. They vaccinate the animals and treat fleas, ticks, and ear mites. They also spay or neutur each pet. After this, they continue to provide care and love until the animal finds their forever home.</p>

					<h5>How to Help</h5>
					<p>Under the information about their facility they include ways that the reader can help. Of course, this includes donations, but it also includes other things. They could become an ARF angel, which is someone who sponsors the adoption of an animal. They encourage people to come adopt if they can. ARF includes direct ways someone can volunteer, such as offering to help clean the kennels, walking the dogs, and even socializing with the cats. Besides monetary donations, they also accept cleaning supplies and non-clumping cat litter.</p>

					<h5>Contact</h5>
					<p>At the bottom of this DIV they include ways to contact the facility, as well as directions to the place. They include their phone number (864-882-4488) and their email (ARF@NCTV.com). Finally they provide the address and directions to the facility. </p>

					<h5>Links</h5>
					<p>This website included a lot of links. The important ones are the cats and dogs in need of homes, their policies, and a link directing the reader to information on how to help. It’s a bit difficult to navigate, as the adoption information and requirements are under “our policies,” which doesn’t seem like the first place to look. There are SO many links on the side navigation bar, some of which are completely different websites. Some information is repeated in multiple sections, and it’s not very organized. Some of these are completely unnecessary links.</p>

					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
					<h3>Articles</h3>
					<h5><a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/pandemic-impacts-animal-rescue-operations">Covid Impacts Rescue Operations</a></h5>
					<p>Covid is impacting everything around us. One effect that many people probably don't think about is how Covid is impacting animal rescue groups. Lucky Cat Rescue, Giles Country Animal Control, and Giles Country Sheriff's Departments (in Tennessee) were called to a property where they found a number of animals living in terrible conditions. Because of Covid, they had to reduce the number of people who could help in the rescue, which caused them to be a the scene much longer than they usually would. Of course, the members were required to wear masks, get their temperature checked, and they had to alter where they planned the rescue. Overall, Covid is changing how animal rescue groups work.</p>
					<h5><a href="https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics">Rescue Statistics</a></h5>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Around 6.5 million animals enter U.S. shelters every year.</li>
							<li>Around 1.5 million animals are euthanized in shelters every year. More cats than dogs. (860,000: 670,000)</li>
							<li>Around 3.2 million animals are adopted from shelters every year.</li>
							<li>APPA reports that around 34% of dogs are bought from breeders. Only 23% of dogs and 31% of cats are adopted from shelters or the humane society.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Successful Animal Rescue Websites</h3>
					<h5>ASPCA</h5>
					<p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is a humane society, non-profit organization. Their mission is "to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States." I found this site to very successful. It's immediately clear what the user is supposed to do, as there are two donation buttons (one in the nav and one on the banner). It's in big, bold font "Join Us Today" encouraging the user to click the button. It's overall very organized. Their response to animal cruelty is immediately under the banner, with an option to stay up to date by signing up for your email and phone number. Below that, there are three buttons. "Donate" "Join Team ASPCA" and "Give Monthly." This leaves no room for the user to question what they are supposed to do. This website also features a footer, and it's a nice footer at that.</p>

						</div>
					</div>

					<h5>Humane Society</h5>
					<p>The Humane Society of the United States is another non-profit animal rescue organization. Again, it's immediately clear what the user is supposed to do. There's an obvious donate button in the navigation bar, along with pertinent links. As the user scrolls down, it becomes clear what the Humane Society's goal is, to end all forms of animal cruelty. It introduces the animal rescue team, giving a short explanation of what they do. After this is another donation button, again subtly letting the user know what to do. The Humane Society also features a footer, with an option to sign up to get alerts with news and "action alerts."</p>
